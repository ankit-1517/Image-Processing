# Digital Image Processing
Repo for assignments done in ELL715: Digital Image Processing @ IIT Delhi

## Description
In each assignment folder, there's the problem statement, the code and the final report submitted.

The main tasks performed in the assignments are:

1. Image Transformations:
    - Polar transformation
    - Shear transformation
    - Geometric	rotation, scaling and translation
2. Image Histogram and Equalization:
    - Computed histogram of an RGB image
    - Improved contrast of a grayscale image using:
        - Contrast Stretching
        - Gamma Correction
        - Histogram Equalization
        - Unsharp masking
3. Image Filtering and Scaling:
    - Analyzed the effect of an IIR filter and unsharp masking (shaprening filter)
    - Played with fourier transform and inverse fourier transform
    - Performed Discrete Cosine Transform on images
4. Image Compression:
    - Implemented bilinear, bicubic, DCT and FFT compression
    - Implemented the Seam carving by removing areas with low energy
    - Impelemnted compression using 2-D Wavelet decomposition
5. Wavelet Analysis:
    - Extracted retinal	blood	vessels from fundus images using:
        - Wavelets
        - Sobel
        - LoG
6. Image Morphing:
    - Separated occluded objects using morphology and thresholding
    - Counted circular objects in an image
    - Detected black note heads
7. Vessel Segmentation using Morphology:
    - Removed the bright, circular shaped Optic Disc
    - Extracted the vessel map
    - Estimated the diameter of thinnest & thickest vessel
    - Removed small isolated patches and smoothened the vessel map
8. Image Segmentation:
    - Implemented segmentation using Intensity based thresholding
    - Implemented segmentation using Region growing
    - Implemented segmentation using Image Matting
9. Optic Disc Segmentation Using Active Contour:
    - Imeplemented algorithm to find the center of the optic disc
    - Developed an active contour algorithm to fit the initial contour at the edges of the disc
    - Removed small isolated patches and smoothened the vessel map
10. Retinal Vessel Segmentation Using Neural Networks:
    - Extracted features for vessel map segmentation
    - Followed leave-one-out strategy to train the neural network
    - Evaluated the performance of algorithm in terms of:
        - Accuracy
        - Sensitivity
        - Specificity
        - Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC under ROC)
